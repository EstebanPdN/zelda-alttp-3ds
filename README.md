# Zelda A Link to the Past 3DS

Nintendo 3DS dual-screen port of Zelda3, built with help from Codex.

This project is based on open-source work from:

- Original reverse-engineered Zelda3 engine: https://github.com/snesrev/zelda3
- Android port base: https://github.com/Waterdish/zelda3-android
- Dual-screen Android branch used as the 3DS source base:
  https://github.com/samyost1/zelda3-android

No ROM or extracted game asset package is distributed in this repository. Each
user must provide their own legally obtained USA, unheadered ROM on their own
3DS SD card.

## Nintendo 3DS Features

- Top screen: 400x240 gameplay.
- Bottom screen: 320x240 live map, dungeon map, gear view, item selection and
  touch settings.
- First launch extracts `zelda3_assets.dat` locally from the user's ROM.
- Display modes: wide mod, stretched original and original aspect.
- Turbo speed: off, x2, x3, x4 or x5.
- New 3DS: ZL or C-stick can hold turbo when turbo is enabled.
- Quick diagnostics: press `L + R + A` to create a dump with memory files plus
  top and bottom screenshots.
- HOME Menu metadata is versioned for each build. v1.6 appears as
  `Zelda ALttP 3DS` / `Zelda A Link to the Past 3DS v1.6`.
- HOME Menu banner uses a lightweight CGFX 3D box model with the supplied
  hover sound converted to a short PCM WAV.

## Installation

Install the CIA, then create this directory on the SD card:

```text
sdmc:/3ds/Zelda 3DS/
```

Place a legally obtained USA, unheadered ROM there. The preferred filename is
`zelda3.sfc`, but the setup also accepts other `.sfc` or `.smc` filenames.

On first launch, press A to validate the ROM and extract the assets. The ROM is
read locally and is never copied into the CIA.

Audio requires:

```text
sdmc:/3ds/dspfirm.cdc
```

Luma3DS can create this file from the console's own firmware through Rosalina's
`Dump DSP firmware` command.

## Releases

Every GitHub release includes:

- installable CIA
- Homebrew Launcher 3DSX
- source snapshot zip
- QR code for scanning the CIA URL from FBI on a 3DS

The release page itself shows the QR code, legal notice and a short changelog.
Detailed development notes are preserved inside the source snapshot.

## Building

Requirements:

- devkitARM, libctru and 3ds-cmake under `DEVKITPRO`
- `makerom` and `bannertool` for CIA packaging
- the vendored SDL2 source in `app/jni/SDL2`
- `banner.cgfx` is prebuilt in `platform/3ds/assets`; it was generated from
  the supplied box glTF with only the base diffuse texture.

Build:

```sh
chmod +x platform/3ds/build.sh
platform/3ds/build.sh
```

The script builds the 3DSX and CIA under `build-3ds/game/`.

## Legal

This repository contains only source code, build scripts, redistributable port
assets and patch/extraction logic. It does not include a ROM, extracted game
assets, or `zelda3_assets.dat`.

Users are responsible for providing their own legally obtained compatible ROM.
